And sincerity is certainly worth defending. You want to know that someone means what he says, that heâ€™s not holding anything back, and that you can trust him to follow through. But sincerity is easier to require from someone else than to produce consistently in ourselves. Paul explains how the grace of God is the only sure path to the sincere lives we want.",
