It calls into question everything we were meant to be and all we try to accomplish. And, from the perspective of the Bible and Hebrews in particular, death is unnaturalâ€“an impostor, a weapon in the hands of a ruthless enemy whose days are numbered. For the death and resurrection of Jesus hold out a promise, a promise that his sacrifice means the death of death itself.",
