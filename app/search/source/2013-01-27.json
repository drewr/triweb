  "blurb" : "One of the ways in which God is holy, in which he is not like us, is his perfect moral righteousness. We redefine what’s right and justify doing wrong; God is perfectly committed to what’s right and unfailingly judges what’s wrong. This makes God’s holy perfection a severe threat. But his holy perfection also comes to us as a promise: God offers us Jesus’s record of perfect righteousness, and by his Spirit we come to love what’s right and hate what’s wrong as God does.",
