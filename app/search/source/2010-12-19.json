Isaiah 9 offers one of the most important clues, hundreds of years before Jesus was actually born. The prophet claims that the people who walked in darkness have seen a light because a child was born. In other words, we’ve got to understand the meaning of this darkness and we’ve got to understand the meaning of this light if we’re to understand the meaning of the child.",
