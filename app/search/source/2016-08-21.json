  "blurb" : "Christian hope is the confident expectation and desire for the promises of God to be true. In the context of 1 Peter, this hope is the confident expectation of Christâ€™s victory over death. Peter gives us three reasons for why we can be so confident in this hope. 1) Our hope is anchored in the past: Jesus has been raised from the dead. 2) Our hope is secure in the future: we have an eternal inheritance being kept for us in Heaven. 3) We are now being guarded by God through faith as we wait.",
