In his letter to the Romans, Paul explains why the gospel is incomplete apart from Jesusâ€™s resurrection. In theory, the resurrection is the foundation of our faith that God accepts us because he accepts Jesus. In practice, it means ours is a peace and a hope that should hold fast no matter our circumstances.",
