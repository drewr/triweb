No one paying attention to the world can deny the reality of innocent suffering–that our experience of the world is far from what we wish it to be, and often our suffering doesn’t make sense. If Job’s friends show us how not to respond to this reality, Job’s own responses to his friends and to his God model authentic faith in our suffering.",
