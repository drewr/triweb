  "blurb": "Several times in this text Jesus gives the same simple command: don’t be anxious. To those of us who struggle with anxiety, that can sound a bit like blaming the victim. Who would really choose to be anxious, after all? But what Jesus offers isn’t a dismissive charge to get over it. Nor is it a comprehensive explanation of everything that goes into anxiety. What he offers are weapons for the battle with anxiety that are powerful no matter what your unique struggle looks like. Recorded 2016-06-19.",
