  "blurb" : "This story captures the first of Jesus’s “signs,” actions that symbolize what he came to do for us. It isn’t as eye-catching as some of his later miracles. There’s no healing of the sick, no calming of a storm, no resurrection of the dead. But when Jesus turned water into wine, he offered a perfect taste of what his coming means for his people: he will turn guilt and shame to unimaginable joy.",
