  "blurb" : "In this story of demon possession and exorcism, Mark returns to one of his favorite questions: what must we do to claim the saving power of Jesus? It’s a story that illustrates what we know from our own experience: unbelief comes from many sources and in many forms. But in the desperate plea of a helpless father Mark illustrates another, even more powerful truth. It’s a decision to rest on Jesus–not mathematical certainty–which constitutes the faith that leads to deliverance.",
