  "blurb" : "By nature, we’re all prone to moralism—to measure ourselves before God and others by our moral performance. This tendency is the enemy of the gospel. In this section of Colossians, Paul makes his case against moralism; he argues that it’s without substance, arbitrary and powerless. The implications for us are both convicting and encouraging: we don’t get to judge others, but we don’t have to fear being judged.",
