  "blurb" : "Several times in this text Jesus gives the same simple command: don’t be anxious. To those of us who struggle with anxiety, that can sound a bit like blaming the victim. Who would really choose to be anxious, after all? But what Jesus offers isn’t a dismissive charge to get over it. Nor is it a comprehensive explanation of everything that goes into anxiety. What he offers are weapons for the battle with anxiety that are powerful no matter what your unique struggle looks like.",
