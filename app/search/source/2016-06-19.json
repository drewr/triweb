Who would really choose to be anxious, after all? But what Jesus offers isn’t a dismissive charge to get over it. Nor is it a comprehensive explanation of everything that goes into anxiety. What he offers are weapons for the battle with anxiety that are powerful no matter what your unique struggle looks like.",
