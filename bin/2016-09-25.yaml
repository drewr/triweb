comment: >
  The story of Ehud and Eglon is not one you'd expect to find in the
  Bible. It's not just that the story is violent. It's also crude and
  darkly comedic. But through the unexpected details we get a picture of
  the God who inserts himself into the messy lives of his people to turn
  their mourning into laughter.
