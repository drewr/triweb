comment: >
  In two places Ecclesiastes laments the power of injustice, and in both
  places the author ties injustice to the problem of death.  If death is
  our end, why do human lives deserve to be protected equally?  And if
  the just and the unjust both end up dying, why worry with justice at
  all?  Our only hope for the justice we crave is a God who sees all
  things and will judge us--all of us--after death.
