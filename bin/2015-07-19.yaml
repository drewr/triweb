comment: >
  Ecclesiastes catalogs the meaningless of life "under the sun"---the
  world as it is if there is nothing and no one that lasts forever.  The
  author takes up his first example with a question: what good is all of
  our work?  The answer?  It all depends on our perspective.  Under the
  sun, our work is a dead end.  But in the Lord, our work is an
  opportunity.
