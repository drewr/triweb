comment: >
  Before teaching us how to pray, Jesus first clarifies why we should
  pray to God in the first place. We should come to God because we love
  him, not from a hypocritical desire to impress other people. And we
  should come to God because we trust him, not from some attempt to
  control him by saying just the right thing.
