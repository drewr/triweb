comment: >
  In Samson--the last of the judges--we see a leader of unprecedented
  power leading a life of unbridled selfishness. We have a judge, in
  other words, who's no better than his people with no interest in
  saving them. But still God uses him. And in his story we get a
  glimpse of the future--of how God saves, and whom.
