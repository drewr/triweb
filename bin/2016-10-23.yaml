comment: >
  The story of Jephthah is a dark one. It is a story of deliverance like
  the others, but the focus is not on his courage or even God's
  power. The focus is Jephthah's tragic misunderstanding of God's
  love - and it shows us our only hope for a peaceful, life-giving
  relationship with God is God's free, undeserved, gracious love for us
  in Jesus.
