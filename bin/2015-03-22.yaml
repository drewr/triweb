  Everybody wants to live a life that's long, peaceful, and loved well
  by others.  Proverbs tells us wisdom---a skill or instinct for living
  life well---is the key.  And Proverbs 3 shows us where all true wisdom
  begins.  It begins with a trust in the Lord that leans on him with
  everything you have and looks for him in everything you face.
