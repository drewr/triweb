COMMENT="If the Christian life amounts to a long, difficult, and painful race, we've got to work as a team to strengthen each other and bind what is broken-to create a community of healing. We must work hard at what God is working out in us; this looks like peace with each other and a fuller dependence on God. And we must take responsibility for each other's faith, pushing each other beyond apathy, hard-heartedness, and fleeting pleasure."
