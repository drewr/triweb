  What is the wise way to respond to innocent suffering?  This question
  is central to the book of Job.  No one paying attention to the world
  can deny the reality of innocent suffering--that our experience of the
  world is far from what we wish it to be, and often our suffering
  doesn't make sense.  If Job's friends show us how not to respond to
  this reality, Job's own responses to his friends and to his God model
  authentic faith in our suffering.
