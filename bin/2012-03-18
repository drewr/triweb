TITLE=2012-03-18-Heb-4-Hold-Fast
AUTHOR="Trinity Church"
YEAR=2012
COMPOSER="Matt McCullough"
ALBUM="The Book Of Hebrews"
GENRE=Sermon
COMMENT="This crucial section of Hebrews offers a summary of what's already been said and a taste of what's still to come. Jesus is the Son of God who became our sympathetic high priest. These titles–admitedly abstract to our modern ears–are introduced for a profoundly practical purpose. They're meant to convince us to hold fast to Jesus because only Jesus offers what we really need."
