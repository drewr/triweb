  Christian hope is the confident expectation and desire for the
  promises of God to be true. In the context of 1 Peter, this hope is
  the confident expectation of Christ's victory over death. Peter gives
  us three reasons for why we can be so confident in this hope. 1) Our
  hope is anchored in the past. Jesus has been raised from the dead. 2)
  Our hope is secure in the future. We have an eternal inheritance being
  kept for us in Heaven. 3) We are now being guarded by God through
  faith as we wait.
