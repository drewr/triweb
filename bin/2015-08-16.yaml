comment: >
  Ecclesiastes is a book about meaninglessness and death, but it's also
  a book about joy.  Many times through the book, the author follows up
  sections on the depressing emptiness of life under the sun by telling
  us to enjoy ourselves as long as we live.  How can we live with joy in
  a world so full of vanity?
