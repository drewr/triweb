COMPOSER="Matt McCullough"
ALBUM="The Book Of Hebrews"
GENRE=Sermon
COMMENT="Using a vivid example from Israel's history, this passage helps us understand the nature of a disease we all share and how we can fight it. Sin is a heart condition: it deceives, it hardens, and it feeds on unbelief. The only true remedy for our disease is a deeper affection for Jesus, which grows as we encourage and challenge one another."
