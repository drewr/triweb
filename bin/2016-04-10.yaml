comment: >
  In this section of the sermon on the mount, Jesus calls us to hearts
  that are empty of anger and full of reconciliation. We feel our need
  of a savior because we can never meet this standard perfectly.  We
  also consider practical ways to avoid anger and pursue reconciliation
  that flow from transformed hearts that rest in the finished work of
  Christ.
