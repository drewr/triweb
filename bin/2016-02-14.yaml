  Some of us need to be told that it's possible to be satisfied.  Some
  of us need a reminder that we're more hungry than we may realize.  All
  of us need the challenge and the comfort in Jesus's promise that
  satisfaction comes to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
  So what is righteousness?  And what are you hungry for?
