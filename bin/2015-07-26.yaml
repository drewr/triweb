comment: >
  Can lots of pleasure make a short life meaningful?  That's the
  question the author of Ecclesiastes set out to answer with the lavish
  lifestyle he describes in this passage, a lifestyle where did anything
  and everything he wanted to do.  His experiment reached an awful
  conclusion, but his wisdom paves the way for a joyful alternative.
