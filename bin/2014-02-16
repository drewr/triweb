COMMENT="This story captures the first of Jesus's \"signs,\" actions that symbolize what he came to do for us.  It isn't as eye-catching as some of his later miracles.  There's no healing of the sick, no calming of a storm, no resurrection of the dead.  But when Jesus turned water into wine, he offered a perfect taste of what his coming means for his people: he will turn guilt and shame to unimaginable joy."
