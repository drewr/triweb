COMMENT="To see the glory of Jesus—to fully believe in him and rest in his power—we must see him in light of the problem he came to solve, the problem of death.  And when we’ve seen the glory of Jesus—when we’ve tasted the sweetness of what he offers by his life, death, and resurrection—we come to see the problem of death in a whole new light."
