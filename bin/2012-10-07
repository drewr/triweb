COMMENT="This conclusion to Hebrews's list of faith's exemplars offers a striking contrast.  Sometimes faith brings back the dead, and sometimes faith costs everything.  But the key point is this: if Jesus is alive, the difference between gaining or losing everything in this life doesn't ultimately matter."
