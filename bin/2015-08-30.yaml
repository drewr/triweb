comment: >
  James opens his letter full of commands with perhaps the most
  surprising command of all. He insists we're to see the trials we face
  in life as cause for joy.  It is through trial that we grow in
  maturity, through trial that we're protected from a faith that's not
  genuine.  So sort of trial should we expect?  And where can we get
  what we need to persevere?
