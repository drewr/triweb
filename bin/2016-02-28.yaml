  For one reason or another, we want to see God.  We want to understand
  the forces in the world that are bigger than us and outside our
  control.  We want to know that there's meaning beyond our own
  preferences and something that last longer than our own lives.  We
  want to know the claims of the Bible are true, that we aren't alone in
  our suffering, that our connection to God can be more than abstract
  and impersonal.  We want to see God, and Jesus promises that it's
  possible---for the pure in heart.  So why is it necessary to be pure in
  heart?  And how can I become pure in heart?
