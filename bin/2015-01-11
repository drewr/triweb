COMMENT="The opening scenes in the story of Jesus's death tell a story of great courage, as Jesus faces his captors with unflinching resolve and in absolute control.  They tell a story of great cowardice, as Peter faces his own examination and denies Jesus repeatedly.  And they tell a story of great compassion: Jesus dies on purpose because he knew Peter would deny him, and he knew we'd deny him too."
