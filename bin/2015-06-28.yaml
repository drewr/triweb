  Job's lost everything even though he'd done nothing wrong.  His main
  desire was to know why.  Near the end of the book, in a passage of
  remarkable power and beauty, God finally speaks to him.  But what
  God says is not what Job expected.  He doesn't mention Job's
  experience at all.  He responds instead with a poem celebrating the
  vastness, complexity, and wildness of the natural world.  How is
  this response helpful?
