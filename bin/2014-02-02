COMMENT="This story of Jesus's life begins not with Jesus himself but with a figure called John the Baptist, one sent to prepare the way for the Christ.  Following John's lead, we get a clear picture of what we must know about ourselves and about Jesus if we're to truly enjoy what Jesus offers us."
