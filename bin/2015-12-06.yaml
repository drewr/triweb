comment: >
  James finishes his letter by calling us to do for each other what he
  had done for his friends through his letter.  He calls on every one of
  us to pursue everyone with the truth, because everything is on the
  line.  We're all responsible for helping each other bridge the gap
  between what is true about God and what is going on in our lives.
