comment: >
  One of the main reasons Paul wrote this letter was to defend his own
  sincerity against people who thought he was speaking from both sides
  of his mouth. And sincerity is certainly worth defending. You want
  to know that someone means what he says, that he's not holding
  anything back, and that you can trust him to follow through. But
  sincerity is easier to require from someone else than to produce
  consistently in ourselves. Paul explains how the grace of God is the
  only sure path to the sincere lives we want.
