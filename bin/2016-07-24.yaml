comment: >
  Jesus concludes his famous sermon with a call to decision. There is no
  middle way.  Everyone who hears Jesus's sermon will either accept him
  or reject him. How should you make this choice? Christians choose
  Jesus not because he's popular or because he's easy to follow, but
  because he's the only way to life.
