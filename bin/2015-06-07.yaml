comment: >
  Job tells the story of a man who was wise and good, enjoying all the
  benefits of wisdom that Proverbs predicts.  Job had everything, then
  he lost everything, and it wasn't his fault.  Job's suffering raises
  questions none of us can avoid if we're paying attention.  At one
  level, there's the mystery around all innocent suffering: what is God
  doing?  At a deeper level, suffering raises a question of worship: can
  we love God for himself, even if we lose the things we want to get
  from him?
