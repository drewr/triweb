COMMENT="Jesus teaches that if we love him we will obey him, and if we don't love him we won't obey him.  The key to our behavior---what we do---is in the affections---what we love.  That's why Jesus's promise of a Helper, the Holy Spirit, is such good news.  The promised Spirit is also a promise of a new heart moved by love for Jesus."
