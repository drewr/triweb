COMMENT="Paul's first letter to the church in Corinth covers a full range of issues basic to human life across the centuries. It's a letter about politics and competition, about fashion and style, about sex and money and food. And straight through every issue it's about selfishness and the power of cross-centered love to overcome the root of evil. It's a letter well-summarized by Paul's final instruction: \"Let all that you do be done in love.\""
