comment: >
  James claims that the wisdom of the wise shows up in meekness or
  humility.  Why?  Because the wise know wisdom comes as a gift, not an
  accomplishment.  The wise know wisdom is for serving others, not
  proving themselves.  And the wise know wisdom is for making peace, not
  winning battles.
