COMMENT="Isaiah's beautiful descriptions of God's plan to redeem sinners are only good news for us if we know that they're promises to us, and if we know how we're supposed to respond to his word. This story of King Hezekiah in crisis--one of Isaiah's only stories--is meant to show us what it looks like to claim God's promises. It looks like a trust that's rooted in despair, centered on God and his character, and motivated by God's glory."
