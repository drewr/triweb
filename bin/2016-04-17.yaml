  As Jesus continues to show us what whole-hearted love for and
  obedience to God looks like, we consider three ways that Jesus tells
  us we might be committing adultery --- lust, divorce, and remarriage
  after divorce.  Plumbing the depth of our sin, we also plumb the
  depth of Christ's love and mercy.  And we come to the glorious
  conclusion that Christ is enough.
