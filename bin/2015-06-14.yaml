  Job is about the wise way to respond to suffering, but it's not just
  about your own suffering.  It's about how to respond wisely to the
  suffering of others.  The largest portion of Job is a back-and-forth
  conversation between Job and three of his close friends, friends who
  came to comfort him but made a horrible job of it.  We can learn how
  to comfort one another with wisdom by recognizing what Job's friends
  got wrong.
