  Proverbs 18:21 claims that "death and life are in the power of the
  tongue."  That's a strong claim, for sure, but it's proven over and
  over again in our experience.  Our words have incredible power to hurt
  others or to help them.  And few things offer so clear a window into
  our hearts.  So how do we use our words wisely?
