comment: >
  Throughout his letter James has been showing us what it looks like to
  live as if we truly believe that God is and that he is for us in
  Jesus.  It makes sense, then, that he would close his letter with a
  call to prayer.  Prayer demonstrates the fear of the Lord that is the
  source of all wisdom.
