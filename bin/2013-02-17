COMMENT="Isaiah presents idolatry--worshipping and trusting what isn't God--as one of Israel's most consistent and most significant problems. And though the symptoms have changed from culture to culture, idolatry is a heart disease we all carry. This chapter helps us understand what idolatry is, why it's useless, how we're guilty of it, and how we can be saved from it."
