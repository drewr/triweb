GENRE=Sermon
COMMENT="There is an ironic truth at the heart of the story Christians commemorate as Holy Week. The same man hailed as king one day is shamefully executed a few days later, and that death was inextricably linked to his becoming king. Hebrews helps us understand why Jesus had to die to become king, and its explanation has a great deal to do with a mysterious figure called Melchizedek."
